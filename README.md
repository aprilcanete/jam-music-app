# JAM MUSIC APP

Welcome to Jam Music app, our take on a spotify inspired music player with a focus on putting the lyrics front and center while the user listens t their favourite tunes.

## Languages and tools

The entire application was built using react.js coupled with the  spotify API. We were able to draw both the music and lyrics from the one API.

## The Journey

Like most journeys, ours started with outright enthusiasm about all the features we were going to implement. We initially broke it down into 5 key elements that we could all work on separately:

* Music Player
* Search bar
* Synced Lyrics (Karaoke style)
* User Login
* User Playlist

We initially believe we would need separate API's for both music and lyrics but realized late into our journey that spotify could handle both.

## Obstacles and wins

The biggest obstacle was working with OAuth as no one on the team had ever done so before. This turned out to be our biggest obstacle and it took a few days for us to tame the beast

## Unsolved issues

At time of presenttaion our unsolved issues are:

* Working out how to sync up lyrics with the songs. This was much more difficult than we originally realized.
* Generating playlists

## Other features we did not get to

* One feature discussed very early on was to have a character on screen whose pose and mood would change depending on how many songs were left in the playlist - zero songs = mad, less than 3 = sad, over 5 = happy etc.
